# oh-pi-zsh, a quick install of the excellent Oh-My-Zsh addon for the Zsh shell for RaspPis running Raspbian or any Debian based distro

Works with root or standard user, but standard user is suggested as some aliases are defined to sudo, etc.
From home directory, clone this directory, chmod +x setup/*.sh, then run "setup/pi_prereq_install.sh && setup/oh_my_zsh_install.sh" from a shell to get started
